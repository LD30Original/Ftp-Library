# Ftp-Library
A Library written in C# to download files from a FTP server using FTPS.
My plan is to build on this to create a streaming client for files on the FTP server.

Note that this Client only works on Linux FTP servers due to the lack of universal FTP standard. The Server used for testing is a FileZilla server.
